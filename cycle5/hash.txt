Hashtable is an array of size = TABLE_SIZE
Step 1: Read the value to be inserted, key
Step 2:  let i = 0
Step 3: hkey = key% TABLE_SIZE
Step 4 :compute the index at which the key has to be inserted in hash table
                index = (hkey + i) % TABLE_SIZE
Step 5: if there is no element at that index then  insert the value at index and STOP
Step 6: If there is already an element at that index
                step 4.1: i = i+1
step 7:  if i < TABLE_SIZE then go to step 4
Algorithm to search a value in linear probing

Hashtable is an array of size = TABLE_SIZE
Step 1: Read the value to be searched, key
Step 2:  let i = 0
Step 3: hkey = key% TABLE_SIZE
Step 4: compute the index at which the key can be found
               index = (hkey+ i) % TABLE_SIZE
Step 5: if the  element at that index is same as the search value then print element found and  STOP
Step 6: else
                step 4.1: i = i+1
step 7:  if i < TABLE_SIZE then go to step 4
